Next Steps for App Development:

1.Fetch Actual Email Messages:

Description: Implement functionality to fetch actual email messages (including subject lines, senders, etc.) using the Google Gmail API.

Notes: Use the access token to make authenticated requests to the Gmail API and display email data.



2.Store Access Token:

Description: Decide where to store the access token securely.

Options:

In-memory storage (useful for session-based storage).

Persistent storage (e.g., a database for long-term storage).

Notes: Ensure the token is encrypted and only accessible by authorized users.



3.Token Refresh:

Description: Set up a mechanism to refresh the access token using the refresh token.

Ensure the app can automatically refresh tokens without requiring the user to re-authorize.

Notes: Handle token expiry and set up automatic refreshing in the background.
